The Firebase SDK might throw an error if you try to access a property of a document snapshot before the snapshot has fully loaded. This is a common mistake that can lead to unexpected behavior. For example, if you try to access snapshot.data().someProperty before the snapshot has completed loading, you'll get an error. This is because snapshot.data() returns null before the data is loaded.
